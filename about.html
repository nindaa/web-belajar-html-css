  		<p>Hello!!</p>
  		<p>I am Ninda Ramadani. My friends used to call me Ninda. I was born in Makassar, 29 December 1999. I am the result of a combination of Javanese and Enrekang.</p>
  		<p>My father is from Banyumas, Central Java and my mother is from Enrekang district, South Sulawesi. </p>
		<p>From birth to 1 year I lived in Makassar but when I was 1 year old I moved and lived in my mother's village and then the 5th grade elementary school moved back to Makassar.</p> 
		<p>I moved with all my family and only when I was in college now I lived alone and mother returned to her village with my father, brother and sister. </p>
		<p> I am the second of three children and I have one sister who just married last year and one younger brother who will be 5 years old this year </p>
		<p> My hobby is cooking and likes to spend time alone in the room. If I don't have an activity then I will do my hobby. </p>
		<p> Sometimes I like to take part in some volunteer activities to fill my time and to just add experience and acquaintances. </p>
